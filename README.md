ubiquitous-capture
==================

Capture scribbles as images to your SDCard. Meant for GTD ubiquitous capture.

Small application to capture scribbles to the SD card. It is created to be easily accessible. This is achieved by:

* Permanent notification for easy and ubiquitous access.
* Closing or saving will store the scribble as PNG and close the app.

Code for the canvas is based on a sample from http://www.mysamplecode.com/
